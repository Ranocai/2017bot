STATUS
    2017-01-10:

      - CANTalon motor controllers work just fine when driven by the new (as
        of this year) third-party TalonSRXLibJava.  We shouldn't have a
        problem continuing to use the Talons this year, or with using them to
        drive Mechanum wheels.  The drive train this year is easy and only
        needs one joystick unless we get fancy.

      - To alleviate my own cranial pressure when debugging the drive, Talon
        assignments for the wheels were changed to 0, 1, 2, and 3 for the
        front left, back left, front right, and back right respectively.
        Imagine a backward "N" drawn on top of the robot and you'll have the
        right idea.

    2017-01-11:

      - Compilation error fixed with commit 4cd44d6.  The key was putting the
        correct relative path in the userLibs variable from build.properties.
        That appears to be the only way to edit the classpath used by the
        javac compiler (the Eclipse IDE uses a different classpath that is
        driven by the GUI.)

TASKS
  1. Finish crimping the frayed CANTalon wiring so that we can get proper
     electrical contacts.

  2. Fork a Java thread in robotInit() to listen on a port for network
     requests.  Log whatever's received.

  3. Test client using netcat to send requests to the IP of the RoboRIO over
     the known port.

  4. Start work on a formal client using C++ code to do the same as (3).

CONFIGURATION
1. Useful Git config settings:

   git config user.name YourUserName
   git config user.email YourEmail@Address.com

   [This command allows you to do free-form commits with Notepad++ if it's
   installed in the right folder.  Feel free to modify the path.]

   git config --global core.editor "'C:/Users/frc1/Documents/Notepad++Portable/Notepad++Portable.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"

   [This command defines a command, "git ll", which is more useful than the
   normal "git log" command, and then a short version, "git l".]

   git config alias.ll '!git log --graph --decorate --color --stat | git name-rev --stdin --refs=refs/heads/master | less -r'
